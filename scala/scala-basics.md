# Scala notes
Notes from [Modern Web Development With Scala](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-scala/read_sample)

## Values
* `val` defines a constant
* `var` defines a variable (rarely used)

* Constants and variables infer types if none is given
* Types can be explicitly stated after the const or var name:
		* `val myNum: Short = 4`

## Methods
* `def` defines a method
* Methods are defined with their arguments in parentheses, and types must be supplied for arguments. Supplying the type of the return value is optional. If supplied, it appears after the parentheses:

```scala
// No return type
def greet(name: String) = "Hello " + name

// Return type
def greet(name: String): String = "Hello " + name
```
	
* The body of a method can either be on the same line as the signature, or you can use a line break. Curly braces are not required:

```scala
def greet(name: String) =
		"Hello " + name
```
* The last expression in a methods body will be it's return value - there is no need to use a return keyword.
* If a method is used in a procedural way and will not have a return value, you can specify its return type as `Unit`
* If methods do not have parameters, the parentheses can be omitted when defining the method. However this method will need to be called without parentheses too, so when calling this method it will look like you are accessing a value:

```scala
def id = Math.random

// This works
id 
// => Double = 0.34234

// This does not
id() 
// => Error to let you know this method does not accept parameters
```

* Functions can be defined and assigned to a variable or constant

```scala
// To specify the return type (a function from String to String)
val greetVar: String => String = (name) => "Hello " + name

// To infer the return type
val greetVar = (name: String) => "Hello " + name
```

* Methods can also be assigned to consts and vars by adding an underscore after the reference:

```scala
def greet(name: String): String = "Hello " + name
val sayHello = greet _

sayHello("Oreo") 
// => "Hello Oreo"
```


## Type hierarchy
![Scala types](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/unified-types-diagram.svg)
* Everything in Scala has a type, and inherits from `Any`: `Any => [AnyRef, AnyVal]`
* Primitives inherit from `AnyVal` and reference types inherit from `AnyRef`: `AnyRef => [List, Option, YourClass] AnyVal => [Double, Float, Boolean]`
* Types can be checked using `isInstanceOf`: `"Hello".isInstanceOf[String] => Boolean: true`
* Scala also has _bottom types_ which implicitly inherit from other types (more later)

### Collections
* Scala lists are created and accessed in the same way, using parentheses: 

```scala
val myList = List(1, 2, 3)
myList(0) 
// => 1

val myArr = Array(1, 2, 3)
myArr(0) 
// => 1
```

* Lists in Scala always have a type, and one will be inferred from the items in a list if no type is specified (if mixed types exist, the type will be `Any`
* A lists type can be supplied in-between the keyword `List` and the parentheses containing the list items: `val myList = List[Short](1, 2, 3)`
* By default, Scala uses immutable collections, which come with attached methods that create new collections rather than altering the existing collection. For example the `:+` method:

```scala
val listA = List(1, 2 ,3)
val listB = listA :+ 4

listA 
// => List(1, 2, 3)
listB 
// => List(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

### Packages and imports
* Classes in Scala are organised into packages, so in order to use it you can either use the fully qualified name (FQN), or import the class:
```
// FQN:
val myList = scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer.empty[Int]

// import
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
val myList = ListBuffer.empty[Int]
```

* All classes can be imported from a package using the _ wildcard: 
```
import scala.collection.mutable._
val set = HashSet[Int]()
```

* Imports do not have to happen at the beginning of a file - they can be used within a class or method.

###Â Classes
* Classes can be defined using the `class` keyword, and are called on using the `new` keyword:
```
class Animal(name: String) {
}

val myPet = new Animal("Oreo)
```

* As in the above example, putting parameters inside parentheses defines a constructor for the class with those parameters. Any parameters defined here can be used within the body of the class, however will not be accessible properties on an instance of the class. In order to make these accessible they can be prepended with `val` (to make it immutable) or `var` (to make it mutable:
```
class Animal(name: String) {
	def sayName(): unit =
		println(name)
}

val myPet = new Animal("Oreo")
myPet.sayName()
// => prints "Oreo"

myPet.name
// => error - does not exist


class Animal(val name: String) {
	def sayName(): unit = 
		println(name)
}

val myPet = new Animal("Oreo")
myPet.sayName()
// => prints "Oreo"

myPet.name
// => returns "Oreo"
```

* Default methods in a class (such as toString - which comes with every user defined class, as it implicitely extends AnyRef) can be overriden by putting the `override`keyword in from of `def` when defining the method
* A class can have an `apply` method defined on it, which can be called in two ways: by calling `MyInstance.apply()` or adding parentheses after the instance name such as `MyInstance()`
